guides
======
These is a collection of conventions and best practices established and followed
by a community of top-notch programmers worldwide. We try to emphatize
instead of reinvent the wheel.

Our principal motivation to follow these guides is to reduce friction and
learning curves across all the projects we work on. It also helps to reduce
barriers when new developers come aboard.

Inspired by [Thoughtbot's guides](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides) but
suited, estructured and simplified to fit our needs.
